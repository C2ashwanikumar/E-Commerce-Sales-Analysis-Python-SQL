## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to analyze e-commerce data using SQL and Python, offering valuable business insights through a series of queries and data visualizations.

## Project Workflow
1. Import data from 7 CSV files into a SQL database using Python.
2. Perform SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data.
3. Visualize the data using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes e-commerce transactions, customer details, payment information, and more. These files were sourced from reliable open data platforms and processed to provide insights.

## Features

### Basic Queries
1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Find the total sales per category.
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries
1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
2. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
5. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries
1. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
5. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
